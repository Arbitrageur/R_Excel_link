R_Excel_link
============

This repository contains code that makes use of the 'excel.link' R extension package to interact with Excel.  The intention is to use this approach to programmatically drive Excel models by manipulating data inputs, and then read the results back into R.  This will hopefuly enable the use of R's rich feature set to conteract some of the shortfalls of modelling in Excel.

This code requires R and Excel to be installed on the same machine, and the 'excel.link' extension to be intstalled within R (which is PC only).

To install the excel.link package, go the the tools menu from within RStudio, select Install Packages, type 'excel.link' into the 'Package' field of the install wizard and click install.
